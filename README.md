=========

Four separate tabs are contained in JoomGalleryTab:

- User Gallery: display a user's uploaded images
- Favourites: display a user's favourite images (public or private)
- Tagged Images: display the images a user is tagged in
- Comments: displays the comments the user made in the gallery

To install JoomGalleryTab, just install the whole package as plugin in Community Builder. Don't forget to publish the plugin. Each tab contained in the plugin can be published and configured separately in the CB Tab Management.

To update, just uninstall the old plugin in Community Builder and install the new one.
